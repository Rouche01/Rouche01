Hi ü§öüèΩ, my name is Richard and I am a software engineer. I have been developing websites and applications for over 2 years. Most of my experience lies in full stack development and mobile development for hybrid apps using React Native. I have worked with HTML/CSS, Javascript/NodeJS, Typescript, ReactJS and a little bit of Python.

I am passionate about software development, breaking down large problems into sub-tasks and coming up with solutions that are tool or framework agnostic. I have worked with several teams both remote and on-site to come up with solutions that are in production and solve real life problems.

You will find high level summaries of my job duties/education history in my [resume](https://pdfhost.io/v/ZpWMmQx1e_Dev_Resume.pdf). If you want to see some of the projects that I work on in my spare time, check out my GitHub repositories, I have pinned some of my most important ones here.
